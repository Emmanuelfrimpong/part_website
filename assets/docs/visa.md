# J-1 VISA SPONSORSHIP

## How will I be sponsored to teach in the U.S.?

PART is officially designated by the U.S. Department of State as an Exchange Program Sponsor and is authorized to sponsor cultural exchange teachers in the U.S. for the maximum time allowed by the U.S. Department of State. These visas are available only to non-U.S. citizens and non-permanent residents of the U.S. The Visa application fee is approximately $160, which is paid for by the visa applicant.

## How long can I stay in the U.S.?

PART initially hires exchange teachers for one year. That one-year contract may be renewed twice, for a maximum exchange program duration of three years. After three years, your visa will expire, per U.S. Department of State rules. At the end of your exchange program, PART teachers must return to their home countries.
