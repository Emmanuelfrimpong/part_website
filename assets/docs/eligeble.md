# ELIGIBILITY

## How do I become licensed to teach in the U.S.?

All PART teachers must be licensed to teach in the specific states in which they are placed. Before applying for a teaching license, PART will ensure you meet the state’s minimum licensing requirements and you will be notified early in the process if you do not meet these requirements. However, if you are eligible for a teaching license and successfully complete PART’s application process, we will assist you in obtaining your state teaching license once you accept a teaching position. Upon arrival in the U.S., we will provide you with the license application and submit your completed documentation to the state’s department of education.

## Am I eligible to teach with PART if my teaching experience is only with students over the age of 18/college students?

No. PART is only authorized to sponsor and place teachers who have experience and work exclusively in K-12 (elementary and secondary) U.S. schools, serving students that are typically ages 5-18. To qualify for a teaching position with PART, you must be able to demonstrate recent experience with students within this age range.

## Does my degree/diploma meet the minimum requirement of a U.S. bachelor’s degree in education?

Successful PART program candidates have completed college/university-level courses and been awarded a teaching degree/diploma in education or a specific subject with a teaching component. State Department of Education regulations mandate that if your transcripts are from non-American universities, you must provide a certified transcript that has been certified by a member of the National Association of Credential Evaluation Services ("NACES").

Please visit [www.naces.org/](http://www.naces.org/), select a translation company, and follow their instructions for how to submit your transcript to them. Once you receive the certified version (must be in English), please upload it with the rest of your documents to your profile on the PART website.

Please note that many of the NACES translation companies offer different translation and/or certification services. PART requires a "Course-By-Course Report." The price of this service will vary depending on the company you choose to translate your transcripts, so please "shop around" for the best price.

While we accept this course-by-course evaluation from any NACES-member, SpanTran is our recommended international transcript evaluation service. They have created a custom application for PART that will make sure you select the right kind of evaluation at a discounted rate. You can access the application SpanTran Application-PART.

If you have any further questions as to what documents PART requires, please contact PART at [info@PARTeducators.com](mailto:info@PARTeducators.com) before you purchase your translation.

## I do not yet meet the minimum application requirements, but will be qualified in the near future?

If you will meet our participation requirements in the future, we encourage you to register with us once you have met the minimum requirements for participation.

## Am I eligible if my teaching experience is in a different subject than my teaching degree/diploma?

PART must ensure that our participants meet state standards for teacher licensure and certification and confirm that each teacher’s experience is in the appropriate area. As such, eligibility is determined by several factors that vary by applicant. However, if most of your teaching experience is in a subject area or age level other than that which you were trained to teach, it is not likely that you would qualify for the program. An ideal applicant will have a degree & training as well as recent teaching experience all in one subject area.

## How does PART evaluate my English language fluency?

One of the most important factors in a school district choosing a teacher for placement, beyond meeting the eligibility requirements for the PART program, is their fluency in English. All PART exchange teachers must be able to read, write, and speak English nearly as well as your native language. The entire application process, from registration to hiring and placement, is performed in English. Though there is not a formal “fluency test”, PART will be evaluating your English fluency while reviewing your application and in speaking with you personally during one or more online interviews.
