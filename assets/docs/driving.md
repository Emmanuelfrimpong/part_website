# DRIVING

## I don’t currently have a driver’s license. Do I need one?

PART exchange teacher applicants must provide a copy of a current & valid driver’s license from their home country as a part of their application. Please note that probationary licenses are not accepted. PART also strongly recommends that all teachers have at least one year of consistent driving experience.

## Why is driving ability so important?

Public transportation is not as available in the United States as it may be in other countries. As such, in order to travel to and from work as well as within your local community, you must be able to drive safely. Public transportation is not widespread in many U.S. cities and towns so driving is often a necessity. Applicants should be confident of their driving ability before applying to the program.
