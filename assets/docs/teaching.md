# TEACHING

## Where will I be teaching?

PART currently works with school districts located in South Carolina.

## What will I be teaching?

The subject or grade level you are assigned to teach will depend on your educational degrees as well as your previous classroom teaching experience. Although PART accepts applicants of all teaching backgrounds, it should be noted that there is currently a higher demand for teachers that have experience and specialize in teaching:

Sciences | Mathematics | Special Education | Foreign Languages | Early childhood Education | Elementary Education

## Will I be working for a school district?

If chosen to be an exchange teacher with PART, you will be sponsored by PART to teach in a school within the network of your host school district—meaning you be under the supervision of and will receive your pay from your host school district. In your day-to- day teaching duties, you will report to your school’s principal or other faculty administrator and will be subject to the policies and procedures followed by all school faculty in the school district in which you are placed. However, as your U.S. Department of State J-1 Visa sponsor, you will also be evaluated by PART staff on an ongoing basis in cooperation with your school district’s administration.

## When do positions begin and end? When is school not in session?

Exact school year dates vary depending on school district. Generally, U.S. school years begin in August or early September and continue until late May or early June. Whether you are placed in a school district before school starts or during a school year, your annual contract will end on the same day each year.

PART exchange teachers, as well as U.S. teachers, are given specific holidays and time off according to the policies and procedures determined by their school districts. Teachers in traditional schools typically have two weeks of holiday time in December/January and a little over two months of time off in the summer. PART teachers often take this time to travel around the U.S. or visit their home country.

Once placed in a school district, PART exchange teachers who accept positions in the U.S. must review faculty/staff handbooks and calendars for their assigned schools to determine when they are required to be at school. PART teachers are expected to work all days in the school calendar, including required and optional teacher workdays, unless taking leave with prior approval from school officials.
