# FINANCES AND BENEFITS

## What will my starting salary be?

Your salary will be based on your education level, years of classroom teaching experience, and your host district’s specific salary schedule. Please visit the [South Carolina Department of Education Salary Schedule](https://www.indeed.com/career/teacher/salaries/SC?mna=&&aceid=&kw=adwords_c_6194641982_20276384154_0_0_pmax&sid=us_googcontjspmax_tech_EHPW9_c__g_9067653_gclid$_Cj0KCQjwho-lBhC_ARIsAMpgMof3JBpAcaBmfvfekU6N_vwi0vWs42bK3d6Px_cZ08dt4yeWdLBnatkaAojKEALw_wcB&gclid=Cj0KCQjwho-lBhC_ARIsAMpgMof3JBpAcaBmfvfekU6N_vwi0vWs42bK3d6Px_cZ08dt4yeWdLBnatkaAojKEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds) website to find out more.

Numbers along the top row represent years of classroom teaching experience. The far-left column lists education level: “8” = a doctorate; “7” = a Master’s degree plus 30 credit hours; “1” = a Master’s degree; “2” = a Bachelor’s degree plus 18 hours; and “3” = a Bachelor’s degree.

## How much money should I bring with me?

PART recommends you bring enough funds for relocation, transportation costs and living expenses to cover the time between your arrival in the U.S. and your first pay check.

You also need to be aware that there will be a two week to one month delay in receiving your first pay check. This means that your first pay check will not show up in your bank account until two weeks to one month after you start teaching. With that knowledge, you need to budget accordingly before you come to South Carolina. That being said, you will receive one or two more pay checks after your employment with your host school district ends. The amount you need to bring depends on where you will live and whether you come alone or with family members.

In addition, PART recommends that you bring a credit card to the U.S. Obtaining a credit card immediately after arrival in the U.S. can be very difficult. If you will be bringing a credit card to the United States, make sure to notify the card’s financial institution that you will be using it in the United States.

## How much does housing cost?

The cost for housing varies depending on the area in which you live, if you live in a house, or apartment. Typically, teachers will have roommates. Sharing an apartment with a roommate saves on living expenses and responsibilities.

How will I manage my finances as a PART teacher?

PART will assist you in opening an account with a bank when you arrive in the United States. You will be paid by your host school district via direct deposit, which means your district will deposit your pay check directly into your new bank account, minus agreed upon withholdings (such as federal and state taxes, health insurance, etc.)

## Is my travel to the U.S. paid for?

PART provides our first-year teachers with airline tickets from major airports in their home countries to PART’s Orientation in Columbia, South Carolina. Additional travel to and from your home country for holidays and visits will be at your expense, including a return ticket at the end of program participation. All travel for family members is also at your own expense.

## What health benefits are offered?

- PART, at its own expense, will provide health, accident, medical evacuation, and remains repatriation insurance to its exchange teachers. Per U.S. Department of State requirements, health insurance will include:
    - Medical benefits of at least $100,000 per accident or illness
    - Repatriation of remains coverage amounting to $25,000
    - Expenses associated with the emergency medical evacuation of the exchange visitor to his or her home country in the amount of $50,000
    - A deductible of no more than $500 per accident or illness
- J-1 exchange teachers have the option of either accepting this free insurance through PART, or they may purchase their own health insurance. If visiting teachers wish to purchase their own insurance for themselves, they must submit a letter to PART certifying the health insurance they have purchased meets the above minimum requirements, as well as list the insurance carrier providing coverage.
- J-2 dependents must also have the same insurance coverage as the J-1 exchange teachers. PART can offer this coverage to J-2 Dependents, but it will be the financial responsibility of the J-1 exchange teacher to cover this cost.
