# APPLICATION PROCESS

## Do I have to pay to teach with PART?

No. Unlike some other teaching exchange companies in the United States, applicants do not pay PART at any time during the application process. However, there are some costs charged by others which may include: ordering copies of degrees and transcripts from your colleges or universities; local police background checks/letters of good conduct; U.S. visa fees; any application fees related to J-2 dependents who wish to live and work in the U.S.; U.S. teaching licensing fees.

## What are the steps to apply to teach with PART?

Applying to PART is a competitive process that, depending on the applicant’s credentials and the current needs of the school districts, could take anywhere from several weeks to several months. Review the APPLICATION PROCESS page for a step-by-step breakdown of the entire application process.

## Can I apply to teach with PART through postal mail?

No. PART only accepts applications online through our website. REGISTER HERE 

## I have teaching experience, but not recently. Can I still apply?

U.S. school districts prefer to host international teachers who are currently teaching or have very recent teaching experience. If you have not been teaching full time but have been involved in K-12 education in some other way, please visit our **REGISTRATION PAGE** so PART can evaluate your candidacy fully.

## I previously submitted an application. Do I need to reapply?

If your application was submitted more than one year ago, you must submit a new application. **CONTACT US** via email to check on the status of your application and documents submitted within the past year.

## I previously taught in a teaching exchange program. Can I still apply to PART?

The U.S. Department of State requires that exchange teachers return to their home countries at the conclusion of their exchange period. If you have spent at least two consecutive years in your home country following your previous exchange program, **REGISTER HERE** to start your online application.
