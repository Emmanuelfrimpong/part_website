**APPLICATION PROCESS**

**Do I have to pay to teach with PART?**

No. Unlike some other teaching exchange companies in the United States, applicants do not pay PART at any time during the application process. However, there are some costs charged by others which may include: ordering copies of degrees and transcripts from your colleges or universities; local police background checks/letters of good conduct; U.S. visa fees; any application fees related to J-2 dependents who wish to live and work in the U.S.; U.S. teaching licensing fees.

**What are the steps to apply to teach with PART?**

Applying to PART is a competitive process that, depending on the applicant’s credentials and the current needs of the school districts, could take anywhere from several weeks to several months. Review the APPLICATION PROCESS page for a step-by-step breakdown of the entire application process.

**Can I apply to teach with PART through postal mail?**

No. PART only accepts applications online through our website. REGISTER HERE 

**I have teaching experience, but not recently. Can I still apply?**

U.S. school districts prefer to host international teachers who are currently teaching or have very recent teaching experience. If you have not been teaching full time but have been involved in K-12 education in some other way, please visit our **REGISTRATION PAGE** so PART can evaluate your candidacy fully.

**I previously submitted an application. Do I need to reapply?**

If your application was submitted more than one year ago, you must submit a new application. **CONTACT US** via email to check on the status of your application and documents submitted within the past year.

**I previously taught in a teaching exchange program. Can I still apply to PART?**

The U.S. Department of State requires that exchange teachers return to their home countries at the conclusion of their exchange period. If you have spent at least two consecutive years in your home country following your previous exchange program, **REGISTER HERE** to start your online application.

**ELIGIBILITY**

**How do I become licensed to teach in the U.S.?**

All PART teachers must be licensed to teach in the specific states in which they are placed. Before applying for a teaching license, PART will ensure you meet the state’s minimum licensing requirements and you will be notified early in the process if you do not meet these requirements. However, if you are eligible for a teaching license and successfully complete PART’s application process, we will assist you in obtaining your state teaching license once you accept a teaching position. Upon arrival in the U.S., we will provide you with the license application and submit your completed documentation to the state’s department of education.

**Am I eligible to teach with PART if my teaching experience is only with students over the age of 18/college students?**

No. PART is only authorized to sponsor and place teachers who have experience and work exclusively in K-12 (elementary and secondary) U.S. schools, serving students that are typically ages 5-18. To qualify for a teaching position with PART, you must be able to demonstrate recent experience with students within this age range.

**Does my degree/diploma meet the minimum requirement of a U.S. bachelor’s degree in education?**

Successful PART program candidates have completed college/university-level courses and been awarded a teaching degree/diploma in education or a specific subject with a teaching component. State Department of Education regulations mandate that if your transcripts are from non-American universities, you must provide a certified transcript that has been certified by a member of the National Association of Credential Evaluation Services ("NACES").

Please visit [www.naces.org/](http://www.naces.org/), select a translation company, and follow their instructions for how to submit your transcript to them. Once you receive the certified version (must be in English), please upload it with the rest of your documents to your profile on the PART website.

Please note that many of the NACES translation companies offer different translation and/or certification services. PART requires a "Course-By-Course Report." The price of this service will vary depending on the company you choose to translate your transcripts, so please "shop around" for the best price.

While we accept this course-by-course evaluation from any NACES-member, SpanTran is our recommended international transcript evaluation service. They have created a custom application for PART that will make sure you select the right kind of evaluation at a discounted rate. You can access the application SpanTran Application-PART.

If you have any further questions as to what documents PART requires, please contact PART at info@PARTeducators.com before you purchase your translation.

**I do not yet meet the minimum application requirements, but will be qualified in the near future?**

If you will meet our participation requirements in the future, we encourage you to register with us once you have met the minimum requirements for participation.

**Am I eligible if my teaching experience is in a different subject than my teaching degree/diploma?**

PART must ensure that our participants meet state standards for teacher licensure and certification and confirm that each teacher’s experience is in the appropriate area. As such, eligibility is determined by several factors that vary by applicant. However, if most of your teaching experience is in a subject area or age level other than that which you were trained to teach, it is not likely that you would qualify for the program. An ideal applicant will have a degree & training as well as recent teaching experience all in one subject area.

**How does PART evaluate my English language fluency?**

One of the most important factors in a school district choosing a teacher for placement, beyond meeting the eligibility requirements for the PART program, is their fluency in English. All PART exchange teachers must be able to read, write, and speak English nearly as well as your native language. The entire application process, from registration to hiring and placement, is performed in English. Though there is not a formal “fluency test”, PART will be evaluating your English fluency while reviewing your application and in speaking with you personally during one or more online interviews.

**TEACHING**

**Where will I be teaching?**

PART currently works with school districts located in South Carolina.

**What will I be teaching?**

The subject or grade level you are assigned to teach will depend on your educational degrees as well as your previous classroom teaching experience. Although PART accepts applicants of all teaching backgrounds, it should be noted that there is currently a higher demand for teachers that have experience and specialize in teaching:

Sciences | Mathematics | Special Education | Foreign Languages | Early childhood Education | Elementary Education

**Will I be working for a school district?**

If chosen to be an exchange teacher with PART, you will be sponsored by PART to teach in a school within the network of your host school district—meaning you be under the supervision of and will receive your pay from your host school district. In your day-to- day teaching duties, you will report to your school’s principal or other faculty administrator and will be subject to the policies and procedures followed by all school faculty in the school district in which you are placed. However, as your U.S. Department of State J-1 Visa sponsor, you will also be evaluated by PART staff on an ongoing basis in cooperation with your school district’s administration.

**When do positions begin and end? When is school not in session?**

Exact school year dates vary depending on school district. Generally, U.S. school years begin in August or early September and continue until late May or early June. Whether you are placed in a school district before school starts or during a school year, your annual contract will end on the same day each year.

PART exchange teachers, as well as U.S. teachers, are given specific holidays and time off according to the policies and procedures determined by their school districts. Teachers in traditional schools typically have two weeks of holiday time in December/January and a little over two months of time off in the summer. PART teachers often take this time to travel around the U.S. or visit their home country.

Once placed in a school district, PART exchange teachers who accept positions in the U.S. must review faculty/staff handbooks and calendars for their assigned schools to determine when they are required to be at school. PART teachers are expected to work all days in the school calendar, including required and optional teacher workdays, unless taking leave with prior approval from school officials.

**FINANCES AND BENEFITS**

**What will my starting salary be?**

Your salary will be based on your education level, years of classroom teaching experience, and your host district’s specific salary schedule. Please visit the [South Carolina Department of Education Salary Schedule](https://www.indeed.com/career/teacher/salaries/SC?mna=&&aceid=&kw=adwords_c_6194641982_20276384154_0_0_pmax&sid=us_googcontjspmax_tech_EHPW9_c__g_9067653_gclid$_Cj0KCQjwho-lBhC_ARIsAMpgMof3JBpAcaBmfvfekU6N_vwi0vWs42bK3d6Px_cZ08dt4yeWdLBnatkaAojKEALw_wcB&gclid=Cj0KCQjwho-lBhC_ARIsAMpgMof3JBpAcaBmfvfekU6N_vwi0vWs42bK3d6Px_cZ08dt4yeWdLBnatkaAojKEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds) website to find out more.

Click on the most current salary schedule spreadsheet and open the spreadsheet. Find your host district and use the information below to find your approximate gross salary:

Numbers along the top row represent years of classroom teaching experience. The far-left column lists education level: “8” = a doctorate; “7” = a Master’s degree plus 30 credit hours; “1” = a Master’s degree; “2” = a Bachelor’s degree plus 18 hours; and “3” = a Bachelor’s degree.

**How much money should I bring with me?**

PART recommends you bring enough funds for relocation, transportation costs and living expenses to cover the time between your arrival in the U.S. and your first pay check.

You also need to be aware that there will be a two week to one month delay in receiving your first pay check. This means that your first pay check will not show up in your bank account until two weeks to one month after you start teaching. With that knowledge, you need to budget accordingly before you come to South Carolina. That being said, you will receive one or two more pay checks after your employment with your host school district ends. The amount you need to bring depends on where you will live and whether you come alone or with family members.

In addition, PART recommends that you bring a credit card to the U.S. Obtaining a credit card immediately after arrival in the U.S. can be very difficult. If you will be bringing a credit card to the United States, make sure to notify the card’s financial institution that you will be using it in the United States.

**How much does housing cost?**

The cost for housing varies depending on the area in which you live, if you live in a house, or apartment. Typically, teachers will have roommates. Sharing an apartment with a roommate saves on living expenses and responsibilities.

How will I manage my finances as a PART teacher?

PART will assist you in opening an account with a bank when you arrive in the United States. You will be paid by your host school district via direct deposit, which means your district will deposit your pay check directly into your new bank account, minus agreed upon withholdings (such as federal and state taxes, health insurance, etc.)

**Is my travel to the U.S. paid for?**

PART provides our first-year teachers with airline tickets from major airports in their home countries to PART’s Orientation in Columbia, South Carolina. Additional travel to and from your home country for holidays and visits will be at your expense, including a return ticket at the end of program participation. All travel for family members is also at your own expense.

**What health benefits are offered?**

- PART, at its own expense, will provide health, accident, medical evacuation, and remains repatriation insurance to its exchange teachers. Per U.S. Department of State requirements, health insurance will include:
- Medical benefits of at least $100,000 per accident or illness
- Repatriation of remains coverage amounting to $25,000
- Expenses associated with the emergency medical evacuation of the exchange visitor to his or her home country in the amount of $50,000
- A deductible of no more than $500 per accident or illness
- J-1 exchange teachers have the option of either accepting this free insurance through PART, or they may purchase their own health insurance. If visiting teachers wish to purchase their own insurance for themselves, they must submit a letter to PART certifying the health insurance they have purchased meets the above minimum requirements, as well as list the insurance carrier providing coverage.
- J-2 dependents must also have the same insurance coverage as the J-1 exchange teachers. PART can offer this coverage to J-2 Dependents, but it will be the financial responsibility of the J-1 exchange teacher to cover this cost.

**J-1 VISA SPONSORSHIP**

**How will I be sponsored to teach in the U.S.?**

PART is officially designated by the U.S. Department of State as an Exchange Program Sponsor and is authorized to sponsor cultural exchange teachers in the U.S. for the maximum time allowed by the U.S. Department of State. These visas are available only to non-U.S. citizens and non-permanent residents of the U.S. The Visa application fee is approximately $160, which is paid for by the visa applicant.

**How long can I stay in the U.S.?**

PART initially hires exchange teachers for one year. That one-year contract may be renewed twice, for a maximum exchange program duration of three years. After three years, your visa will expire, per U.S. Department of State rules. At the end of your exchange program, PART teachers must return to their home countries.

**DRIVING**

**I don’t currently have a driver’s license. Do I need one?**

PART exchange teacher applicants must provide a copy of a current & valid driver’s license from their home country as a part of their application. Please note that probationary licenses are not accepted. PART also strongly recommends that all teachers have at least one year of consistent driving experience.

**Why is driving ability so important?**

Public transportation is not as available in the United States as it may be in other countries. As such, in order to travel to and from work as well as within your local community, you must be able to drive safely. Public transportation is not widespread in many U.S. cities and towns so driving is often a necessity. Applicants should be confident of their driving ability before applying to the program.
